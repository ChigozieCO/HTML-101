# HTML 101

This is just my HTML playground.

Practicing HTML and CSS and also Javascript but that will have a folder of it's own.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Let's write some HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>You probably already get the drift now</h1>
  <p>Head on in and maybe you could learn a thing or two</p>
</body>
</html>
```
